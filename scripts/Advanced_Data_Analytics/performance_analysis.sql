===============================================================================
Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To compare current values against target benchmarks such as:
        • Previous values (e.g., last year/month)
        • Averages
        • Minimums or maximums
    - Example: Current year sales vs. previous year sales (YOY analysis),
               Current month sales vs. average sales, or vs. highest/lowest values
    - To track monthly or yearly trends and growth.
    - To benchmark and identify high- or low-performing entities.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()
    - Value-based Functions: 
        • LAG(): Retrieves values from the previous row (for comparisons)
    - CASE: For conditional trend logic (e.g., flagging growth or decline)
