===============================================================================
Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To compare current values against target benchmarks such as:
        â€¢ Previous values (e.g., last year/month)
        â€¢ Averages
        â€¢ Minimums or maximums
    - Example: Current year sales vs. previous year sales (YOY analysis),
               Current month sales vs. average sales, or vs. highest/lowest values
    - To track monthly or yearly trends and growth.
    - To benchmark and identify high- or low-performing entities.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()
    - Value-based Functions: 
        â€¢ LAG(): Retrieves values from the previous row (for comparisons)
    - CASE: For conditional trend logic (e.g., flagging growth or decline)

-- ðŸ’¡ Query Design Note:
-- 
-- Try to write SQL that is not only efficient but also easy to read and maintain.
-- Using **layered CTEs** is a helpful way to structure complex logic in stages.
--
-- In this example:
-- - The first CTE (`product_sales_by_year`) handles basic aggregation.
-- - The second CTE (`sales_with_analytics`) adds business logic using window functions.
-- - The final SELECT presents clean, labeled output ready for reporting or dashboards.
--
-- This structure makes the query easier to follow â€” like a **data pipeline**, where each layer
-- performs a specific task. It also improves maintainability: if the business logic changes,
-- you can often update just one layer without rewriting the entire query.
