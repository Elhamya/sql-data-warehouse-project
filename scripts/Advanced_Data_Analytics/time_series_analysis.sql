===============================================================================
Change Over Time Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To understand how measures evolve over time, enabling the tracking of trends 
      and identification of seasonality in the data.
    - Core formula: aggregate [Measures] based on [Date Dimensions]. 
      For example: total sales by year, or average cost by month.

Key SQL Functions Utilized:
    - Date Functions:  DATEDIFF(), DATEADD(), DATEPART(), DATETRUNC(), FORMAT()
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
