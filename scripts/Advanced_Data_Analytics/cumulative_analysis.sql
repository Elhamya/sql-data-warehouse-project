Cumulative Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To assess whether the business is growing or declining through the progressive aggregation of data over time, enabling performance tracking.
    - Formula: aggregate [Cumulative Measures] based on [Date Dimensions] 
	  - For example: Running total of sales by year or Moving average of sales by month, ...
    - Useful for growth analysis or identifying long-term trends.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()

-- üìä Monthly Sales with Running Total and Moving Average

-- Step 1: Aggregate sales data at the month level
-- Step 2: Apply window functions to calculate:
--         - Running total of sales 
--         - Moving average of price

	order_date,
	total_sales,
	-- Cumulative sum: adds current row + all previous rows based on order_date
	SUM(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total_sales,
	-- Moving average: progressively averages prices month by month
	AVG(avg_price) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS moving_average_price

-- üß† Notes:
-- - By default, SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...) uses the frame: 
--   RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ‚Äî 
--   meaning it includes all rows up to the current one (cumulative behavior).
--
-- - To calculate a 3-month moving average (including the current month and the two previous months),
--   Use the following window frame:
--   ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
--   ‚Üí This averages the current row plus the two preceding rows, creating a rolling 3-month view.

-- üîç Aggregation Types:
-- - Standard Aggregation: summarizes data for each individual period separately 
--   (e.g., total sales for each month on its own)

-- - Cumulative Aggregation: builds on previous periods to show how values accumulate over time 
--   (e.g., total sales from the beginning up to each month)
